                       Frequenly Asked Questions

FONT FORMATS AND INSTALLATION

* When I try to use Greybeard, everything looks like gibberish: there are
  lots of characters that I don't even recognize. What's going wrong?

  You have tried to use the source bdf files in the distribution
  directly, rather than following the steps described in INSTALL. That
  does not work, sorry. The source bdf files use a proprietary encoding
  and have to be converted into a standard format during the
  installation process.


* Why do you use some weird encoding and glyph names that are not the
  standard Postscript names.

  Neither the Unicode order of glyphs nor the standard Postscript names
  are particularly well-suited for font design. As a designer one would
  like to have something more systematic, for instance all glyphs that
  share some element should have related names and should come one after
  another in the font file. Greybeard uses the bdfmangle utility to
  convert the source bdf files into Unicode (or any other) encoding. If
  you have an application that really cares about Postscript names (most
  programs using pcf fonts don't care), you can use fontforge to change
  the names.


* The source of Greybeard is in bdf format, which is then compiled in two
  steps into pcf format. Are precompiled versions of the fonts
  available?

  Not from me. Greybeard has a large number of configuration options, but
  that is possible only if the final pcf files are compiled from the
  source. With precompiled versions, this flexibility would be lost.


* Are there ports for $LINUX_DISTRIBUTION?

  As far as I know, there are packages for SourceMage and Arch Linux.
  If you are familiar with packaging and if you'd like to prepare such
  a port for another distribution, drop me a note.


* What should I use to edit VARIANTS.dat and TARGETS.dat?

  Both files can be edited using any text editor, for example emacs,
  vim, gedit, kate, nano, or notepad. Do not use a word processor,
  such as LibreOffice Writer or Microsoft Word.


* I edited VARIANTS.dat and TARGETS.dat, but now I get syntax error
  messages when I run make.

  The directory "backup-config" contains backup copies for VARIANTS.dat
  and TARGETS.dat. Copy them to the main directory and try again.


* I need the compiled bdf fonts of Greybeard, rather than the pcf fonts.
  How do I get them?

  Type "make bdf" instead of "make". The compiled bdf fonts are stored
  in "genbdf".


* I don't have "make". What can I do?

  That means that you are not using anything Unix-like, right? For
  MS Windows, you might use Cygwin. Alternatively, try this:

    perl bin\bdfmangle bdf\t0-12.bdf VARIANTS.dat mgl\unicode.mgl > genbdf\t0-12-uni.bdf
    perl bin\bdfmangle bdf\t0-12b.bdf VARIANTS.dat mgl\unicode.mgl > genbdf\t0-12b-uni.bdf
    perl bin\bdfmangle bdf\t0-14.bdf VARIANTS.dat mgl\unicode.mgl > genbdf\t0-14-uni.bdf
    perl bin\bdfmangle bdf\t0-14b.bdf VARIANTS.dat mgl\unicode.mgl > genbdf\t0-14b-uni.bdf
    ...
    perl bin\bdfmangle bdf\t0-22.bdf VARIANTS.dat mgl\unicode.mgl > genbdf\t0-22-uni.bdf
    perl bin\bdfmangle bdf\t0-22b.bdf VARIANTS.dat mgl\unicode.mgl > genbdf\t0-22b-uni.bdf

  This should at least give you the Unicode bdf versions of the
  even-sized fonts. For the odd-sized ones, it's unfortunately more
  complicated, you need something like

    perl bin\mkshallow bdf\t0-12.bdf > za
    copy /b za + bdf\t0-11.bdf zb
    perl bin\bdfmangle zb VARIANTS.dat mgl\unicode.mgl > genbdf\t0-11-uni.bdf

  and analogously for the other sizes and styles. (Disclaimer: This is
  untested. I don't use MS Windows.)


* What about other font formats?

  Let's face it, bdf as a format is not long for the world. Greybeard
  strives to be usable in a modern context, so attention has been paid
  to rendering it in a modern context. Currently, it renders to .dfont,
  and has been tested with success in OSX High Sierra. ttf should be
  following shortly, though we will need some help with testing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

FONT STYLES AND SIZES

* What is special about the odd-sized versions of Greybeard?

  The odd sizes (6x11, 7x13, 8x15, 9x17) are generated mostly
  automatically from the corresponding even ones (6x12, 7x14, 8x16,
  9x18) using the mkshallow script. The source bdf files for these
  fonts, say bdf/t0-13.bdf, contain only those glyphs for which the
  automatic conversion from bdf/t0-14.bdf might fail. Note that this
  height reduction does not work well for certain scripts, in
  particular Georgian, Armenian, Thai, and pointed Hebrew. Use the
  even-sized versions instead.


* Will any more font sizes be added to Greybeard?

  That's very unlikely. A 6x11 matrix is already too small for something
  like Thai, anything below that would be ridiculous. One could create a
  10x20 font, but it's a rather inconvenient size: too large for a font
  with stroke width 1 and too small for stroke width 2. Above 11x22, it's
  recommend to use outline fonts. (The larger sizes have the advantage
  that hinting in an outline font becomes less important; on the other
  hand designing a bitmap font becomes more and more tedious).


* What about the missing italics?

  In a bitmap font, italics work only (in as aesthetically acceptable
  way) if certain relationships between the character height, the
  character width, the stroke width and the inter-character space are
  satisfied. For 8x16 it works, for 9x18 it works at a pinch, for 6x12,
  7x14 and 11x12 it doesn't. Bold italics are even worse. Sorry.


* Will you make a scalable version of Greybeard?

  No.


* Can I get a font in which some characters are bold or italic, and
  the others are not?

  Yes. Here is an example. Let's say you want to replace parentheses
  and square and curly brackets in the 8x16 font by their bold versions.

  (1) First generate the Unicode bdf files for the regular and the bold
  8x16 font using "make bdf". The files are named "genbdf/t0-16-uni.bdf"
  and "genbdf/t0-16b-uni.bdf".

  (2) You need a file that contains the bdfmangle commands for those
  characters that you want to replace. Use a text editor to create
  a file "replace.mgl" with the following content:

    PUT PParenL
    PUT PParenR
    PUT PSquareBrackL
    PUT PSquareBrackR
    PUT PCurlyBrackL
    PUT PCurlyBrackR

  The names of the characters can be found in "CHARSET". Depending
  on which characters you want to replace, you can also grep the
  appropriate lines from mgl/unicode.mgl; for instance

    $ grep 'PUT Gk' mgl/unicode.mgl > replace.mgl

  yields a replacement file for all Greek letters.

  (3) Use bdfmangle to generate a file that contains only the parentheses
  and brackets from the bold font:

    $ perl bin/bdfmangle genbdf/t0-16b-uni.bdf replace.mgl > tmp-16.bdf

  (4) Concatenate genbdf/t0-16-uni.bdf and tmp-16.bdf (the order is
  important!), filter the result once more through bdfmangle to produce
  a Unicode bdf file, and replace the old Unicode bdf file for the 8x16
  font by the new one.

    $ cat genbdf/t0-16-uni.bdf tmp-16.bdf | perl bin/bdfmangle - mgl/unicode.mgl > new-16.bdf
    $ mv new-16.bdf genbdf/t0-16-uni.bdf

  (5) If necessary, repeat steps (3) and (4) for other font sizes.

  (6) Run "make" to generate and install the remaining files:

    $ make
    # make install

  Note that you can only merge fonts with the same dimensions. Combining
  characters from, say, the 8x16 and the 9x18 font will not work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESIGN ISSUES

* Some characters that involve accents, tone marks, or Thai or Hebrew
  vowel signs are not displayed correctly.

  Greybeard is a bdf font and the bdf format does not provide means
  for proper positioning of floating accents. Consequently, all
  combinations of letters and diacritical marks for which no precomposed
  glyphs are available must be implemented by naive overprinting. The
  results are obviously not optimal.


* Why is there a curly apostrophe (and a curly grave accent)? It
  violates the Unicode standard.

  No, it doesn't. Unicode is a character set standard, not a glyph
  standard. Whatever it says about glyphs is, quite explicitly, not
  normative. A font that represents the entire Latin alphabet using
  German blackletter does not violate the Unicode standard. A font that
  represents all lowercase letters by uppercase glyphs and uses the same
  glyph for U and V (following ancient tradition: SENATVS POPVLVSQVE
  ROMANVS) does not violate the Unicode standard. A font in which U+0027
  and U+0060 are represented by slanted and curly glyphs does not
  violate the Unicode standard either. It's not a bug; it's a conscious
  design decision.

  In fact, what Unicode really says about apostrophe glyphs is the
  following (Unicode 6.1.0, Ch. 6, Section "Apostrophes"):

  |  When text is set, U+2019 right single quotation mark is preferred
  |  as apostrophe, but only U+0027 is present on keyboards. Word
  |  processors commonly offer a facility for automatically converting
  |  the U+0027 apostrophe to a contextually selected curly quotation
  |  glyph. In these systems, a U+0027 in the data stream is always
  |  represented as a straight vertical line and can never represent a
  |  curly apostrophe or a right quotation mark.

  Note that, for typical applications of Greybeard, the assumption above
  does not hold: No sane person uses a monospaced low-resolution bitmap
  font like Greybeard for wisiwyg typesetting in a word processor.
  Anyhow, for somebody who uses proper Unicode quotes (U+2018, U+2019)
  in a natural language text, the appearance of U+0027 doesn't matter,
  as long as it can be distinguished from U+2018 and U+2019. (In UW
  ttyp0, U+0027 and U+0060 are curly and slanted, whereas U+2018 and
  U+2019 are curly and unslanted.)
  
  On the other hand, the appearance of U+0027 does matter for people who
  type or read natural language text and who have to deal with data in
  some 8-bit character set. And for them, a directed curly glyph for
  U+0027 looks right in some contexts (if used as an apostrophe or as a
  closing quotation mark), and wrong in some other contexts (if used as
  an opening quotation mark), but an anorexic vertical stroke looks
  wrong all the time.

  Some people claim that a neutral, vertical glyph is more appropriate
  for programming. It seems that that the inventors and developers of
  Ada 95, C, C++, Common Lisp, Eiffel, GNU Emacs, Java, Perl, Smalltalk,
  the Bourne shell, and TeX did not share this opinion. At least, none
  of them used a neutral glyph in their language descriptions (Taft and
  Duff 1997, Kernighan and Ritchie 1988, Stroustrup 1991/1997, Steele
  1990, Meyer 1992, Stallman 1997, Arnold and Gosling 1997, Wall et al.
  1991/1996, Goldberg and Robson 1989, Bourne 1983, Knuth 1986). So,
  it's at most a matter of taste. If you don't like the default, get the
  source, edit VARIANTS.dat, and type "make".


* Could you raise the asterisk or tilde/dot the zero/reduce the angle
  of the less and greater signs?

  These glyphs are already present in Greybeard. Get the source, edit
  VARIANTS.dat, and type "make".


* Could you make these variants the default ones?

  No. But the build process may be modified to build all variants
  in the near future.

* Why are some characters in the italic fonts not italic?

  Using italics is uncommon for Hebrew typesetting, so italics are
  replaced by semi-bold. Mathematical operators are never italicized in
  mathematical texts, so these characters are just copied from the
  upright fonts; the same applies to dingbats and line graphics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHARACTER ENCODINGS

* I have generated a font for some (not so common) encoding, but some
  characters are not displayed correctly/not displayed at all. What's
  going wrong?

  Most likely, there is some discrepancy between what you see and what
  the operating system assumes. The assumptions of the OS and the
  application about your character encoding are described by a so-called
  "locale". The locale defines, among others, which character codes
  represent letters, which ones represent other printable characters,
  and which ones represent non-printable control characters. Changing a
  font does not automatically change the locale. So, if you use a MS
  Windows CP1251 font, then the code 0x8A corresponds to the Serbian
  letter Lje, but if your locale still says that you use ISO 8859-1,
  then the OS and your applications still assume that 0x8A is a
  non-printable control character. You will have to figure out how to
  change locales (and for more exotic encodings even how to write
  locales).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

POWERLINE

* Can I use Greybeard with the old (not python-based) version of
  vim-powerline?

  Yes, but you have to insert the following lines into mgl/unicode.mgl
  before running "make":

    PUT DVerCtlBranch 0x2B60
    PUT CtlLN 0x2B61
    PUT LtCapF 0x2B62
    PUT LtCapT 0x2B63
    PUT DPadlockCl 0x2B64
    PUT GPlSepArrowRB 0x2B80
    PUT GPlSepArrowR 0x2B81
    PUT GPlSepArrowLB 0x2B82
    PUT GPlSepArrowL 0x2B83


* Some dingbats used by tmux-powerline are missing.

  Most dingbats do not fit well into a 6x12 bitmap, and many dingbats
  do not fit well into any monospaced font, so the dingbat repertoire
  of Greybeard is somewhat limited, but we will accept PRs for suitable
  alternatives.

  Please have a look at "CHARSET" to see what's available and edit the
  tmux-powerline code to use some alternative glyphs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

WILL YOU ...?

* Will you fix bugs in Greybeard?

  Sure! But ideally you'd fix those yourself. :) Submit a PR

* Will you add more characters to Greybeard?

  Submit an issue. Make a case. Maybe. But probably no new scripts
  unless you want to submit a PR for it yourself. There's not enough
  time in the day to maintain a font in an already-dying format.

* Will you copy the missing characters from $OTHER_FREE_FONT into
  Greybeard?

  Maybe. If there's a clear need for it. And if the license is
  compatible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

LICENSE

* Why is this under the MIT license now? Wasn't UW ttyp0 under its
  own license?

  Yes, but that license was simply the MIT license with the additional
  stipulation that the font be dissasociated from its author so that
  he wouldn't have to support any variations that were not his own.
  Specifically, the requirement was that any derived font

  1) not include 'UW' as the foundry and
  2) change the foundry if keeping the name "ttyp0"

  Greybeard has kept neither the foundry nor the name, and I have
  scrubbed all mentions of Uwe's email from the files, fulfilling
  that obligation and then some. Further, I have no concerns that
  people will bombard me with support questions or emails, since
  this is now a hosted open source project. Thus, it stands to
  reason that Greybeard is now simply an MIT-Licensed font.

  Having said all this, my primary intention in modifying this
  font and re-releasing it is to make Uwe's fine work available
  as a crisp programming font to a modern audience, not to claim
  undue credit, and certainly not to misrepresent the intentions
  and opinions of the author or to circumbevent copyright law.
  Thus, if there are any issues with the modified license, font
  content, or any of the prose contained in any of the files in this
  distribution, please submit an issue, and I will be sure to
  give it full consideration and to address any concern as best I
  can.
