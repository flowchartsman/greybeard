INTRODUCTION

This archive contains the source code and auxiliary programs for
installing the Greybeard fonts for X11.

Greybeard is a family of monospaced bitmap fonts in bdf format. It covers
most of the Latin and Cyrillic alphabet, Greek, Armenian, Georgian (only
Mkhedruli), Hebrew (without cantillation marks), Thai, most of IPA (but
no UPA), standard punctuation, common symbols, some mathematics, line
graphics and a few dingbats (about 3000 Unicode characters).

Greybeard comes in nine sizes (6x11, 6x12, 7x13, 7x14, 8x15, 8x16, 9x17,
9x18, 11x22). In all of the sizes there are regular and bold versions;
for 8x15/16 and 9x17/18, there is also an italic.
