.SH NAME
bdfmangle \- transform a bdf font file into another bdf font file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bdfmangle
\fIBDFFILE\fR \fIMGLFILE\fR...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIBdfmangle\fR
is a tool to select, rename, or reorder glyphs in
a bdf font file.
It reads a font file
(or a concatenation of bdf font files
via
\fBcat\fR \fIBDFFILE1\fR \fIBDFFILE2\fR ... | \fBbdfmangle\fR - \fIMGLFILE ...\fR),
manipulates the preamble and the glyphs of the
font file as specified in \fIMGLFILEs\fR
and prints the result to standard output.
.SH "MGL COMMAND SYNOPSIS"
When \fIbdfmangle\fR reads the font(s),
it stores the first preamble that it encounters
(discarding any further preambles)
and the glyphs (bitmaps) of the font(s).
Every glyph is stored independently under its name
(the string following the \fISTARTCHAR\fR keyword)
and under its encoding
(the number following the \fIENCODING\fR keyword).
Formally, a glyph

If several glyphs have the same name or the same encoding,
the last one overwrites the earlier ones.

The preamble and glyphs are then processed according to
the commands in the mgl file(s).
Commands are separated by newlines.
In contrast to bdf files,
numbers in mgl files can be specified
either decimally, or octally (with a \fI0\fR prefix)
or hexadecimally (with a \fI0x\fR prefix).

Preamble commands
.TP
\fBFONT\fR \fIfontnamesuffix\fR
Replaces the trailing part of the font name in the preamble
by \fIfontnamesuffix\fR.
The length of the the replaced part is determined by the
number of hyphens in \fIfontnamesuffix\fR
(the total number of hyphens is left unchanged).
.TP
\fBDEFAULT_CHAR\fR \fInumber\fR
Replaces the \fIDEFAULT_CHAR\fR declaration in the preamble.
.TP
\fBCHARSET_REGISTRY\fR \fIstring\fR
Replaces the \fICHARSET_REGISTRY\fR declaration in the preamble.
.TP
\fBCHARSET_ENCODING\fR \fIstring\fR
Replaces the \fICHARSET_ENCODING\fR declaration in the preamble.
.SS
Output commands
.TP
\fBPUT\fR \fIglyphname\fR [\fInumber\fR]
Prints the glyph stored at \fIglyphname\fR with its old name and
the encoding \fInumber\fR.
If no number is specified,
the encoding of the last glyph printed is incremented by 1.
.TP
\fBPUTAS\fR \fIglyphname\fR \fInewglyphname\fR [\fInumber\fR]
Prints the glyph stored at \fIglyphname\fR with the
new name \fInewglyphname\fR and 
the encoding \fInumber\fR.
If no number is specified,
the encoding of the last glyph printed is incremented by 1.
.TP
\fBPUTENC\fR \fIoldencoding\fR [\fInumber\fR] 
Prints the glyph stored at \fIoldencoding\fR with its old name and
the encoding \fInumber\fR.
If no number is specified,
the encoding of the last glyph printed is incremented by 1.
.TP
\fBPUTENCAS\fR \fIoldencoding\fR \fInewglyphname\fR [\fInumber\fR]
Prints the glyph stored at \fIoldencoding\fR with the
new name \fInewglyphname\fR and 
the encoding \fInumber\fR.
If no number is specified,
the encoding of the last glyph printed is incremented by 1.
.SS
Copy commands
.TP
\fBCOPYTO\fR \fIglyphname\fR \fInewglyphname\fR
Copies the glyph stored at \fIglyphname\fR
to \fInewglyphname\fR,
i.e.,

names[\fInewglyphname\fR] := names[\fIglyphname\fR];

The glyph is afterwards accessible both under its old
and its new name.
If some other glyph was previously stored at \fInewglyphname\fR,
it is no longer accessible by its name
(but it may still be accessible by its encoding).
.TP
\fBCOPYTOENC\fR \fIglyphname\fR \fInewnumber\fR
Copies the glyph stored at \fIglyphname\fR
to the encoding \fInewnumber\fR,
i.e.,

numbers[\fInewnumber\fR] := names[\fIglyphname\fR];

The glyph is afterwards accessible both under its old name
and its new encoding.
If some other glyph was previously stored at the encoding \fInewnumber\fR,
it is no longer accessible by its encoding
(but it may still be accessible by its name).
.TP
\fBCOPYENCTO\fR \fInumber\fR \fInewglyphname\fR
Copies the glyph stored at the encoding \fInumber\fR
to \fInewglyphname\fR,
i.e.,

names[\fInewglyphname\fR] := numbers[\fInumber\fR];

The glyph is afterwards accessible both under the encoding \fInumber\fR
and its new name.
If some other glyph was previously stored at \fInewglyphname\fR,
it is no longer accessible by its name
(but it may still be accessible by its encoding).
.TP
\fBCOPYENCTOENC\fR \fInumber\fR \fInewnumber\fR
Copies the glyph stored at the encoding \fInumber\fR
to the encoding \fInewnumber\fR,
i.e.,

numbers[\fInewnumber\fR] := numbers[\fInumber\fR];

The glyph is afterwards accessible both under its old
and its new encoding.
If some other glyph was previously stored at the encoding \fInewnumber\fR,
it is no longer accessible by its encoding
(but it may still be accessible by its name).
