Greybeard is a chunky monospaced bitmap programming font for all you pixel-perfect nerds who don't like eyestrain. It's based off of [UW ttyp0](http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~uwe/misc/uw-ttyp0/).

It covers most of the Latin and Cyrillic alphabet, Greek, Armenian, Georgian (only Mkhedruli), Hebrew (without cantillation marks), Thai, most of IPA (but no UPA), standard punctuation, common symbols, some mathematics, line graphics and a few dingbats (about 3000 Unicode characters).

It has bitmap strikes in the following pixel sizes: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 22. Each of these has a bold variant, and italic variants are provided in 15, 16, 17 and 18.

It is named after those mythical sysops, staring at white on blue Borland compilers late into the night. Some say they stare still...
